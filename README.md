# accreditation-dashboard-iaps4.0
Accreditation is an activity to evaluate the appropriateness and quality of an educational institution. The National Accreditation Board of Higher Education (BAN-PT) launches the Study Program Accreditation Instrument (IAPS 4.0) to develop accreditation instruments that are relevant to the development of the higher education sector in Indonesia and follow global developments. This required data that supports every aspect of the assessment of IAPS 4.0. The basic problem of the study program is data that is unintegrated. The data and related documents needed are in different databases. So it requires more effort and time to get all the data needed. Then we need a system to integrate, process, and visualize data.  In this repo, we present an application of Business Intelligence in the form of a dashboard using ROLAP (Relational Online Analytical Processing) with website-based visualization. Based on the Requirement Traceability Matrix test that has been done, the data warehouse scheme used has met the needs of the dashboard system.
